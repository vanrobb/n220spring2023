//setup p5 functions setup and draw
//create function polarpoints with one argument r
//in polar points create a variable x
//set x to be equal to the argument r times the math sin function with mouseX as the functions argument
//in polar points create a variable y 
//set y to be equal to the argument r times the math cosine function with mouseX as the functions argument
//in polar points return a p5 function called createVector with x and y as the arguments
//create a variable called res and have res call the function polarpoints
//translate canvas by 100 x pixels and 100 y pixels
//draw a circle at res.x and res.y with a radius of 10
