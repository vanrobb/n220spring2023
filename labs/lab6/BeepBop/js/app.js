//Create a variable that gets the div element
//Create a loop that starts at 0 and increases by 2 25 times
//within loop there will need to be three conditional statements
    //the first conditional statement will be an if statment that determines if the loops value returns 0 when it is a modulo of 3 and 0 when it is a modulo of 5
        //add to the innerhtml of the div beepbop 
    //the second conditional statement will be an else if statement that determines if the loops value returns 0 when it is a modulo of 3
        //add to the innerhtml of the div beep
    //the third conditional statement will be an else if statement that determines if the loops value returns 0 when it is a modulo of 5
        //add to the innerhtml of the div bop
